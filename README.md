# gofeedforward

A multilayer feedforward neural network implemented in Go, trained via backpropagation.  
The purpose of this package is threefold:

- Experiment with building things in Go
- Provide a working implementation of a neural network algorithm that most people start of with
- Provide a useful starting point for a more advanced, optimized implementation

It is not a goal to provide the fastest possible implementation, as those already exist and are inherently not as
readable, especially for people only starting out.

Recommendations are very welcome :)
